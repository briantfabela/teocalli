    This text file contain instances of events within their specific sections
    Here Python will choose a Random line to pick the text for the event.
    Some kewords may determine gains or losses in hp, xp, loot, etc. But generally
    these will be random. The text is meant to provide a more flavorful playing 
    experience with more context for events. All events are in past tense: 
    e.g. "You died", "You found..." All events are a maximum of 90 characters in
    length to better accomodate formatting in the console.

    Other types of events will exist under different section names. Sections are
    meant to help facilitate Python in finding the text needed. In the future if 
    this project retains my interest I may decide to store events and event text
    in JSON format or an SQL table. Whatever is faster and more maintainable, and
    more friendly if anyone wishes to write out more events for the game.

    Here is the general structure for sections:

        ### SECTION NAME ###

        Event text 1
        Event text 2
        Event text 3

        ### SECTION NAME ###

    HURT EVENTS: Will loose a little bit of hp. May gain a little xp, but nothing else.
    BOOBY TRAPS: Events with significant HP loss. May gain a little xp, nothing else.
    XP EVENTS: Events that yield some (more than regular) xp and nothing else.
    RISK EVENTS: Events that increase the risk of the site significantly. Nothing else.
    LOOT EVENTS: Events that yield significant loot and a little xp. Nothing more.
    BIG LOOT EVENTS: Events that yield large amounts of loot. Nothing more.
