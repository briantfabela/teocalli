### HELP ###

    This text file contain instances of events within their specific sections
    For Example, Random style events without major significance are contained
    within the ### RANDOM EVENTS ### Section. Here Python will choose a Random
    line to pick the text for the event. Some kewords may determine gains or 
    losses in hp, xp, loot, etc. But generally these will be random. The text
    is meant to provide a more flavorful playing experience with more context
    for events. All events are in past tense: e.g. "You died", "You found..."

    Other types of events will exist under different section names. Sections are
    meant to help facilitate Python in finding the text needed. In the future if 
    this project retains my interest I may decide to store events and event text
    in JSON format or an SQL table. Whatever is faster and more maintainable, and
    more friendly if anyone wishes to write out more events for the game.

    Here is the general structure for sections:

    ### SECTION NAME ###

    Event text 1
    Event text 2
    Event text 3

    ### SECTION NAME ###

    RANDOM EVENTS: Will always yield at least one type of loot, all else random.
    HURT EVENTS: Will loose a little bit of hp. May gain a little xp, but nothing else.
